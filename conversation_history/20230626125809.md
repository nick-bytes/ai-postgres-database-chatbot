This query retrieves the first 5 rows from the "dim_ticket_prices_tbl" table in the "prod" database. Each row represents a ticket price for a flight, including the flight ID, the price of the ticket, the date of the ticket price, and some additional information. The table contains information about ticket prices from various source systems, such as the mobile app and ERP.

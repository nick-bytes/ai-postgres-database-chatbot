Accommodation bookings in the database contain information about customers who have made reservations for accommodations. Let me shed some light on what this information entails.

Each accommodation booking has a unique identifier, booking date, check-in date, check-out date, and whether the customer has checked-in. It also includes a confirmation code, customer ID, flight booking ID (if applicable), location (city), the number of adults and children, payment method, room type, sales agent assigned, booking status, total price, creation and update timestamps, and source system details.

For example, an accommodation booking might indicate that Customer X made a reservation with the confirmation code "2TRKC1KC2X" for a stay in Maui. The booking was made on May 25, 2016, and the check-in date was April 22, 2018, with a check-out date of April 26, 2018. The customer booked a luxury room for 4 adults using a credit card as the payment method. The booking is currently in a pending status with a total price of $654.04. The record also includes information on when it was created and last updated, as well as the source system (e.g., website, mobile app).

This information allows you to analyze various aspects of accommodation bookings, such as booking patterns, popular destinations, payment methods, room types preferred by customers, and the involvement of sales agents. You can explore further by querying the database with specific questions or performing more in-depth analysis based on your interests and objectives.
